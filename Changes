0.19  2009-04-11 01:03:39
        - Updated for perl 5.10 and 5.6 compatibility.

0.18  2007-11-10  dbr  (svn revision 56)
        - Note version change: synced to libssh2.  Should be compatible with
           libssh2 0.16+, including future versions provided API remains stable.
        - Documented Net::SSH2::version class method.
        - Removed references to LIBSSH2_APINO (removed in libssh2 0.16);
           fixes rt.cpan.org #28722.
        - Fixed memory leak in poll (rt.cpan.org #27368, based on patch
           from David Sullivan).
        - Fixed 0-valued POSIX flag translation bug (based on patch from Joseph
           Galbraith).
        - Check lib64 as well as lib for libraries (patch from Leo Eraly).
        - Add blocking method to Net::SSH2 object.

0.10  2007-02-24  dbr  (svn revision 52)
        - Net::SSH2::SFTP::realpath fix (Hugues Lafarge).
        - Make compatible with perl 5.6 (rt.cpan.org #22821, SISYPHUS); required
           minimal changes to typemap and use <version> lines (untested).
        - libssh2 0.13 seems to work, libssh2 0.14 still fails some tests.
        - Add missing Net::SSH2::PublicKey object.
        - Use (arbitrary) 8K buffer in scp_get and scp_put methods, rather
           than trying to transfer the whole file at once (rt.cpan.org #20679).
        - Remove 'use Term::ReadKey'; it's already 'require'd in the keyboard
           authentication callback (rt.cpan.org #22786).
        - Provide libssh2 with Perl's allocator callbacks and use Perl_malloc/
           Perl_mfree instead of bare malloc/free (rt.cpan.org #23930).

0.09  2006-09-25  dbr  (svn revision 50)
        - scp_get fixes: mode mask, truncate on create (Stephen Clouse).
        - Fix O_CREATE to O_CREAT in perldoc.
        - Fix typo: wait_close -> wait_closed (rt.cpan.org #20117).
        - Add example/ directory and read.pl example to manifest so that it
          gets included in the distribution (Danny Thomas).
        - Add Net::SSH2::debug class method to enable debugging output at
          runtime (used to require recompile to enable).
        - Have poll of empty array return 0 early to fix architectures that
          return 0 for malloc(0) (L. Adrian Griffis).
        - WARNING: latest libssh2 builds (0.13, 0.14) don't pass module
          tests any more; if you have problems try 0.12 or earlier.

0.08  2006-05-06  dbr  (svn revision 46)
        - Fix refcount bug (objects not destroyed) (Stephen Clouse).

0.07  2006-03-17  dbr  (svn revision 44)
        - Remove incorrect statement that poll with timeout of 0 will block.
        - Fix scp_put read size (fix by Pier Hegeman, rt.cpan.org #17370).
        - Fix Win32 check (rt.cpan.org #17656).
        - Fix scp_get buffer overrun (Rutger Ovidus, rt.cpan.org #16886).
        - Update Net::SSH2 SYNOPSIS (thanks to Roy Smith).
        - NOTE: CPAN alias AWA (Vandana Awasthi) released an unauthorized
          "0.07" version of Net::SSH2; you can recognize it because it says
          0.06 in the changelog.  I have not been able to contact AWA.

0.06  2006-01-14  dbr  (svn revision 42)
        - Win32 modifications (thanks to Eric Lam for research and patches).
        - Use MAXPATHLEN instead of PATH_MAX; add some casts (thanks to
          bug report from Freddy Soderlund).
        - Update exec documentation to clarify that it runs a single command
          and closes the channel (thanks to Mike Schmidt).
        - Use '' for tied PRINT output separator if undefined (stop warnings).

0.05  2005-11-11  dbr  (svn revision 40)
        - More C89 fixes (-ansi -pedantic); thanks to Chuck Carson for testing.
